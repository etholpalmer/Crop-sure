**Introduction**
 
> When Sumerian merchants first recorded livestock sales on clay tablets, finance technology was born. Five thousand years later, technology has evolved into a new class of digital tools reshaping every aspect of the business. No matter what future entrepreneurs see for their finance organization, one thing is clear: That future is now. If they’re going to compete in the digital world, their organization needs to forecast and manage more effectively and become more efficient.

 ### Background

***As a group we embarked on a journey to utilize the knowledge gathered of the last six months and apply our understanding of the Fintech industry, it's implications and applications on the world's financial sector. In this project, we will be partaking in a deep dive of what's to come from crytography, smart contracts, decentralize finance, blockchain and crytocurrencies. We are all apprehensive of our knowledge of the Fintech industry, it's growth from the late 1990s, and it's presence in all walks of life. This has proven to be an exciting endeavour and we do hope that enthusiasm shown through.***

Digital disruption is changing what we do, and how we get things done, in countless ways. What does this have to do with the future of Finance? In short **Everything!** Here's the future we see. The eight predictions about digital transformation in Finance:
 
 ![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/rainbow.png)

### The Finance Factory

<p align="left"><img width=75% src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83662813/137217307-acdee3cd-67df-47d6-bbdd-df230cf2ab8f.jpg"></p>

Transactions will be touchless as automation and blockchain reach deeper into finance operations. In the years ahead, cloud-based ERP, automation, and cognitive innovation will continue apace, creating opportunities to radically simplify processes and free up people. Adding blockchain to the mix will only accelerate this trend. As this transition picks up speed, the capacity of humans to add value will be unleashed.

Some find it interesting to speculate about finance disappearing under the crush of digital disruption, but we don’t see that happening. Yes, finance will likely be leaner, but that will mostly be a function of headcount in operational finance (order-to-cash, procure-to-pay, transactional accounting, etc.). Meanwhile, expectations for support from business finance (business partnering, reporting, planning, budgeting, forecasting, etc.) and specialized finance (tax, treasury, IR, etc.) will continue to grow.
 
 ![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/rainbow.png)   

### The Role of Finance

<p align="left"><img width=75% src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83662813/137187176-28be4c64-63fd-48a9-bf71-92cef967da31.jpg"></p>

With Operations largely automated, Finance will double down on business insights and service. Success is not assured. Whether finance continues to direct the resources currently under its control will be dependent on its ability to add value. That will require quality insights and exceptional customer service. Some finance organizations will evolve into full-fledged business service centers.

Companies know that sharing knowledge across disciplines is a good thing, even if it creates headaches. Learn what it takes to make the most of blurring boundaries.
 
 ![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/rainbow.png)   
     
### Finance Cycles

<p align="left"><img width=75% src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83662813/137189565-f0b2aedf-67d7-4d7b-b683-42c778102d3a.jpg"></p>

Finance goes real time. Periodic reporting will no longer drive operations and decisions, if it ever did. When both actuals and forecasts can be produced instantly on demand, traditional cycles become less relevant. The old distinction between operational and analytical data begins to disappear. Finance organizations will still need to meet external demands for cyclical information, but outside investors may also want more frequent performance information. Leading organizations will be operating with a new mantra: There is no close. You’re not forecasting once a month or quarterly. It’s all happening in real-time.

Many finance cycles today are driven by technology and data-processing limitations. Things happen on a regular schedule because that’s the only way they can happen. When information becomes instantly available to those who need it, traditional cycles become unnecessary. That frees people up to focus on discovering new insights and acting on them.
 
 ![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/rainbow.png)   
   
### Self-service

<p align="left"><img width=75% src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83662813/137186180-9db95aa3-9261-4d75-8e65-a84e7e489183.jpg"></p>

Self-service will become the norm. Finance will be uneasy about this. There are plenty of business people who don’t need hand-holding when it comes to basic finance. If they could get their questions answered by a digital voice on their smart phones, they’d be happy to do so. Activities ranging from budget queries to report production and more will be automated. Over time, smart agents will learn what kinds of business information an individual needs, and deliver that information proactively. As that future unfolds, data in spreadsheets will be replaced by visually rich information that is intuitively accessible and easy-to-use.

With growing expectations for responsiveness and quality from finance, getting self-service right is paramount. When your customers are having to take care of themselves, the last thing finance needs is for them to be frustrated or unhappy.
 
 ![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/rainbow.png)
   
### Operating Models

<p align="left"><img width=75% src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83662813/137190242-06021d33-71be-4151-af22-f496296bce25.png"></p>

New service-delivery models will emerge as robots and algorithms join a more diverse finance workforce, think about the integration of freelancers, gig workers, and crowds. Companies will assess the benefits of automation against onshore and offshore operations. Automation provides a new lever for managing costs, one that gives finance organizations the opportunity to reevaluate how they’re organized, where work gets done, and what kinds of processes no longer require human intervention. Finance-as-a-service will gain traction beyond mid-market companies.

Companies may see significant disruption in the offshoring and outsourcing space, with individual suppliers and their capabilities looking quite different than they do today. At the same time, the need to build dynamic, cross-functional teams will strain finance organizations that aren’t preparing now for what’s ahead. As with all changes, good leaders will be essential for navigating these transitions.
   
 ![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/rainbow.png) 
 
### Enterprise resource planning

<p align="left"><img width=75% src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83662813/137186464-27b9831e-dd72-4766-b183-de5a456d9ab7.jpg"></p>

Finance applications and microservices challenge traditional ERP. Big venders will be prepared. ERP vendors are already building digital technologies like automation, blockchain, and cognitive tools into their products, but that won’t forestall competition. Look for the landscape to shift as new players enter the ERP space with specialized applications and microservices that sit on top of—and integrate with—ERP platforms. Cloud-based ERP will help ensure that you’re constantly updated on the latest release.

Finance is entering a golden age of technology. As cloud becomes the norm for ERP, finance applications and microservices will proliferate. You’ll be able to drastically reduce the complexity and cost of technology, without sacrificing functionality.
   
 ![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/rainbow.png)
 
 ### Generic Insurance Framework
 
 <p align="left"><img width=75% src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83662813/138323126-fb8b15c9-810d-4230-b674-fcde0f927fb5.jpg"></p>
 
 The Generic Insurance Framework represents a combined codebase for the Decentralized Insurance Platform, a basic implementation that enables users to develop blockchain-based applications.

The basic idea behind the GIF is to abstract the generic parts shared across multiple different products and leave only product-specific parts, such as risk model, pricing, and payout configurations, to be adjusted. The goal is to enable quick and easy deployment of working products.

In its core, the GIF accumulates a number of componets:

* Core smart contracts
 
* Core microservices
 
* Product-specific smart contracts
 
* Product-specific microservices
 
Essentially, the GIF has two major layers — a smart contracts one and a utility one — with DIP Foundation and partners being able to contribute to both.

The smart contracts layer is designed in the way that any blockchain product built on top of the GIF can be easily implemented into any network supporting the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Any product owner is able to create a full-featured decentralized app by adding a couple of simple domain-specific contracts to a number of generic ones that the framework provides.

The core contracts are deployed on-chain and operate by an instance operator as a shared service for many different products. The instance operator can be a decentralized organization (DAO) or a more traditional legal entity. A product, working on top of the GIF, is a smart contract (or set of smart contracts) connected to the framework’s core contracts through a unique entry point.

The DIP declares the underlying principles and requirements based on which the architecture of smart contracts is developed:

Generic Insurance Framework provides a unified interface, which connects a product to data and decision providers (oracles).
A product contract utilizes a simple and clear interface for integration with the GIF.
Once the agreement is signed and a policy token is issued, parties cannot change the expected policy flow behavior. A policy life cycle should operate on the contracts, which this policy was issued by.
Core contracts can be upgraded. This is needed to make bug fixes and add new features.
 
 
 ![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/rainbow.png)
 
### Data

<p align="left"><img width=75% src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83662813/137186547-c5d76f92-ed10-439b-bc76-a5a8cdb7ab00.jpg"></p>

The proliferation of APIs will drive data standardization, but it won't be enough. Companies will still be struggling to clean up their data messes. Few companies are doing the hard work needed to align and integrate data—which means they won’t capture the full value of digital transformation. Those hoping for a silver bullet to solve their data problems will be disappointed. Automation and cognitive will make it easier to get the work done, but it’s still going to be hard and tedious. What are we talking about? Commas, abbreviations, data-entry fields, nomenclature, and hundreds of similar factors. It’s not glamorous, and it’s not glitzy. But it is important.

Data problems hide beneath the surface for many CFOs, some of whom don’t fully appreciate the heavy lifting required to fulfill their requests. That’s partly because the problems involve technical issues, and partly because there’s little motivation for people to elevate the problems to the corner office. No one wants to be the bearer of bad tidings.
  
 
 ![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/rainbow.png)
   
### Workforce and workplace

<p align="left"><img width=75% src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83662813/137186654-b7033ea7-a358-4983-8cf0-805307851e9e.jpg"></p>

Employees will be doing new things in new ways, some of which will make CFOs uncomfortable. Finance talent models are evolving quickly, with a premium placed on data scientists, business analysts, and storytellers. This represents a dramatic shift for many finance organizations. To get ready, companies will need to make sure that their new hires represent the future they’re striving for. Important qualities include a strong customer service orientation, flexibility, and good collaboration skills—in addition to the technical capabilities needed for specific jobs. Also, all of their people should be able to contribute to elevating the value of finance in terms of communication, impact, and influence. They absolutely have to make every new hire count.

Implementing new technologies is relatively easy compared to changing their talent model. They’re obviously connected, but cultural and organizational shifts related to their workforce may take much more time and care to get right.

  **Web Interface- Website**
Links the smart contract, API, and user interface, allowing end users to input their data and receive usable output. The client can apply for the desired coverage from the website allowing ease of implementation after a series of real time verification processes. 
  
 **Django App**
The Django app was created to allow the clients easy access to the insurance plan and subsequent material. It was designed to create an environment for the insured as a single place to sign into for all their insurance questions and concerns. The Django connects directly to the smart contract ensuring clients can easily apply for any risk management plan they need.  
  
**API - Property Value**
API provides a robust and instant access to the necessary data that is used for estimating the premiums. RapidAPI is able to take an address and return a realistic market value for the property at that address by connecting to Zillow, the leading real estate marketplace. Thus, the clients could receive an quote that reflects the actual risk of their business.
  
**Solidity Contracts**
Solidity is a programming language for writing smart contracts, which are simply programs that run on an Ethereum blockchain. It is based on an ECSMA Script syntax, making it more familiar to web developers. Programs written through Solidity are designed to be run on an Ethereum Virtual Machine.

<h2 id="results-and-discussion"> Results and Discussion</h2>

<p align="justify">
 
Together with the reduction of transaction costs comes an asymmetry of information, which leads to a further increase of costs and to incredible profits for the big insurance companies. The unbounded collection of customer data and the exclusive exploitation of this data is a consequence of this imbalanced relationship. It creates an “unfair competitive advantage” for existing companies: companies with big data vaults can offer better products, and thus further optimize their data base. One of the core goals of a decentralized insurance platform is the disruption of this circle, giving back to customers the ownership of their data.
 
The three elements of an insurance policy; pooling or risk, risk transfer, and efficient administration are necessary. You can’t have insurance without each of them. For the purposes of this capstone project, we called them: 

1. expected value of the risk 
 
2. capital costs for long tail risks 
 
3. transaction costs 
 
Our research showed that, a community may not wish to generate profit from the first element. The second element yields a risk fee for binding capital which depends on the structure of the particular risk: It is typically lower if the risks are granular and uncorrelated; it is typically higher if the risks are clustered or correlated. The third one depends on the complexity of the process. A simple and highly standardized insurance “product” has a smaller transaction complexity than a more complicated, non-standardized one. This will reflect in lower transaction costs. The three elements are completely independent of the underlying technology, economic environment, or currencies. They are the atomic building blocks of every risk-sharing system. 
 
There is a fourth element - Reinsurance. The purpose of reinsurance is to reduce the cost of risk diversification by categorizing and securitizing different risks. Reinsurance and “wholesale” risk transfer enabled by reinsurance adds another layer of complexity, and therefore we as a group decided against discussing reinsurance in this project.
 
 As an additional aspect we have seen the information asymmetry which is inherent in the traditional insurance systems, and which is undesirable. The distribution of expected value (element 1) and capital costs for long-tail-risks among participants (element 2) is inevitable and not specific for a blockchain solution. Therefore, we chose to focus on the third element.
 
Blockchain is essentially - among other aspects - a way to solve the transaction cost problem without firms. Without the “design pattern” of firms, transaction costs are subject to combinatorial explosion. The coordination costs for “n” participants are roughly of Order “O (n^2)” and firms reduce this to “O(n)”. Because of this huge gain in efficiency, firms have many ways to hide profits in the transaction costs, and on the other side internal inefficiencies don’t show up fast. Transaction costs also appear in another context: regulations, which are deemed necessary to protect customers in a context with built in conflicts of interest. Regulations form a very effective “competitor” barrier to entry. While insurance companies often complain about the burdens of regulations, they don’t have much interest in reducing these burdens, as they discourage new competitors from entering the market.
 
While the current insurance business has evolved over centuries, and is optimized in many aspects, we have seen that it has severe shortcomings to the disadvantage of customers. First, an alternative system should of course offer the basic ingredients of any insurance system: covering expected losses, covering long tail risks, and covering of necessary transaction costs. Obviously, we need ways to capitalize such a system, and we need a system to reduce transaction costs to a minimum.
 
Transaction costs cannot be eliminated completely. But open markets have proven to be a solution for these challenges, and therefore, we propose a market-based approach with two components: - an open marketplace for capitalization of risks - an open marketplace for insurance related services This is where blockchain comes into play: a decentralized solution on blockchain can implement such open marketplaces in a way that is collusion resistant and has no single points of failure. We can watch the emergence of many such marketplaces for different domains, like computation, file storage, exchange of assets; and insurance is just another domain in this respect.
 
More specific, blockchain can help to solve four main problems which pile up costs in traditional insurance companies: 
 
1. Coordination (“managerial”) costs. 
 
2. Conflict of interest between customers and company.
 
3. Information asymmetry between customers and company. 
 
4. Access to risk pool
 
As a group, we learned that, to offer an alternative to traditional company-centric insurance systems, we can identify some requirements and consequences for implementing a decentralized insurance protocol.
 
### Requirements and consequences of a decentralized implementation ###
 
1.	 a protocol and not just an (decentralized) application. Insurance is way too complex to be covered by a single application and needs some means to incentivize participants to use it. While a single contract can handle a single product, this singularity will not generate the network effects which are desirable to form multiple large pools of similar risks needed to get the benefits of the “law of large numbers” working. Decentralized insurance will work only if the value chain is decomposed and there is a way different participants can cooperate on the process in an interoperable way.
 
2.	A decentralized insurance protocol can replace “the firm”, by implementing a standardized set of rules for how stakeholders in the system interact with smart contracts and with each other using the protocol. By this, most of the coordination costs are replaced by autonomous and automated contracts and procedures and enforce efficiency by open market mechanisms. At the same time, a protocol does not impose a fixed set of code to the participants but allows for flexible extension and interpretation of the basic rules.
 
3. The development and operation of a protocol needs funding. Even if we can drastically reduce the coordination costs, there are still the costs for the initiation of the system - e.g., acquisition of licenses, development of smart contracts, audits, as well as costs for agents at the “rim” of the system which we cannot eliminate completely. Therefore, we need a way to collect these costs from the ultimate customers and distribute them amongst these agents.
 
4.	We also need a way to calculate and distribute the expected value of the risk and the capital costs for covering long tail risks amongst the customers.

The “cropsure” team concluded that tokenization may be the solution for these requirements - but only if the token is intrinsically required for the protocol to operate efficiently, i.e. “baked into” the protocol itself and usage of the protocol is only possible via tokens. If the token were not intrinsic to the use of the platform, then some new actor could replicate the protocol except without the token and migrate users to the new protocol without the friction of a purely "rent seeking" token.
